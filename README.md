# LinuxInEnglish

The goal of this repo is to describe basic linux commands and skills in a way beginners can understand. It's hard to find definitions or answers about linux online without getting into nitty-gritty details about whatever you want to run and new users get discouraged quickly after trying to learn something "simple". Everything can be complicated, I want to keep it a simple as possible. This may result in some complexity or features of programs not being explained, but I'll try to make sure all the salient details get on here.
